     <p> While the game is only a concept idea, it's planned versions spark a
      variety of different games! The first upcoming version will be a simple
      table top style around cards and 2D characters. </p>
    <p> Before we look into the first version, I will explain a bit about how
      this project has come about and where i plan to take it! </p>
    <h3 font-size="24px"> The beginning: </h3>
    <p> Tales of <strong>Rievara</strong> first began as a simple dream or
      idea.</p>
    <p> Back in 2018, I decided to create my own concept of a game that at the
      time i believed could become something know worldwide! During this point I
      had began creating characters with backstories and even trying to invision
      a world to inhabit. The initial idea was to create a world torn apart by
      vicious wars around different races, allowing people to choose a race
      (similar to "Skyrims" character creation) each race had their own
      individual stats and skills, however they also had different reputations
      with other races impeding on the available wares and types of rewards. </p>
    <p> While this idea hasn't been forgotten about, it wont be</p>
    <p>included in the first Beta version. instead this feature will most likely
      be developed in future versions with more additional features and upgraded
      graphic style alongside the gameplay. </p>
    <p> With each character concept came it's challenges, these consisted of
      things such as different style warfare, different culture, currency and
      even language barriers that were considered for the game. However these
      remain ideas and have not yet seen any further developement or expansion,
      this may change in future but for the time being this idea seems fairly
      far fetched. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="initial">
      <h3 font-size="24px"> <underline>Initial start:</underline> </h3>
    <p>
      On august 17th 2019, the project took it's initial first step in many to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was originally being tested as a server concept on "Minecraft" it lasted for 4 months, after this point the project was failing to follow the original concept.
        Because of the lack of originality and the size it became, the project was getting harder to fund and control. 
        </p>
  <p>
    Even with the challenges presented the project continued to be expanded on, with newer concepts, a variety of characters and newly added hostile concepts.
        After this point the project had seen some major improvements, however it was postponed due to the lack of funds and technical issues with the equipement used.
        The improvements seen were as followed:
        <li>Map layout</li>
        <li>Character creation</li>
        <li>Architectual desings</li>
        <li>Terrain designs</li>
      
      </p>
    <p>
      These changed have been implemented into the upcoming features, however the quality and graphics side has 
      abandoned a 3D look to the terrain and building style, because of this the style and graphics are being left out of this version and will be included in future updates. 
    </p>
  </div>
    <div id="where">
      <h3>Where we are now!</h3>
    <p>
      After 9 months of constant brick walls and difficult challenges the project was revived once again.
      The project however, has changed to cater for a single developer and because of this will start as a small table top.
      </p>
      <p> 
        while the style of game lacks in graphic design and vision unlike the previous draft, it allows for the project to lift off the ground and gain a wider understanding of what and where it will go.
        The projects concepts have stayed the same, with a similar backstory, recreated races and towns with the addition to extra characters and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of March 28th the project has finally taken a leap forward and developement has begun, while at first this website has taken the first step the game will begin its developement by mid june. 
          The game concept has all been finalised and rules have been established to give people a opportunity to learn before it's release!
