# project 2 official website
In this project i plan to revive or rather reinstate a website around an idea i created back in 2019.

My plan is to use my website to help bring a following and a small fan base towards the game i'm striving to build.
Tales of Rievara is a project revolving around a fantasy RPG MMO game idea, while currently the website describes what is to be released in July. I fully intend to continue developing the website to cater for the new information as the overall project begins to take flight.

This project is designed to explain to new followers exactly how the project started, where it is now and where i plan to take it, all of this information along with those who assited in it's first attempted creation are found on the home page to showcase what we are about.

Additonally there are more pages which are designed to give people explanations on how to play the game, how different cards work and some of the additional skills before the actual release.
This has been done to gather information on the audience reaction to the style and gameplay for the inital build.
More pages such as the Gallery and Contact page include the information relevant, Gallery is sectioned giving clear indication to what artwork relates to which area. Whereas the contact page has dirrect links to my social media and a youtube account, it also holds more indepth information about the original team and what they helped with during its first and sadly failed attempt from 2019.

I must also add that all Artwork i've used was purchased or given permission to use and all original artists have been credited and will be expanded upon in the contact page. 

While creating the form, it doesn't load or rather send information to the desired location. this is due to not hosting a live site instead of a local host. while the form loads and functions it doesn't send information to an email address and loads a 501 httpstatus not found. With this, the form must be loaded in a local file so it doesnt load the css file connected to the form.

Furthermore, I have added a update page with a carousel to show people updates and sneak peaks to new game features etc. we have also added new social media logos on the bottom of the screen in the footer, while some are connected directly others only go to the site instead of a profile. 

Finally, i'd like to make a note that although i'm uploading my original code as a portfolio, that all rights to the website and the game included in my second portfolio belong to Mythical Industries. and cannot be used elsewhere by others. I only say this as i've invested into this project and im concerned the original copy could be used by someone else, therefore I am stating that this project although submitted to the code institute solely belongs to myself and is not in any way to be used by others.

Mythical Industries is a company run by myself. 

Thank you
