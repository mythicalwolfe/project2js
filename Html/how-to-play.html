            <p>
                Tile cards act as <strong>movement </strong>spaces, the tiles have a variety of terrains, encounters and hostiles.
                There are a total of 52 tiles in a deck and each card has 2 tiles! at the start of a players turn they pick up a tile card and place it somewhere on the playable map.
                the tiles are:
                <li>Movement Tiles</li>
                <li>Enemy Tiles</li>
                <li>Encounter Tiles</li>
                <li>Dead End Tiles</li>
                <li>Effect Tiles</li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Movement</strong> tiles allow players to move throughout the map, however when a player encounters a <strng>Dead End</strng> tile it prevents any movement in that direction and can no longer have tiles placed connecting to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Encounter</strong> tiles have a variety of different chances, 
                        players can come across <strong>Traders</strong> allowing them to buy and sell equipement and items, 
                        <br>
                        <strong>Quests</strong> Some encounters will have quests attached giving players rewards on completion these can be found in towns too, 
                        <br>
                        <strong>Skill</strong> encounters have 2 different types: Players can come across a multiple choice skill based test or a test of their base special stats, depending on the outcome will affect the reward given, 
                        <br> 
                        <strong>Carnival</strong> The carnival is a unique encounter that allows players to attempt games to gain rewards once per person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Tile cards can also have some negative affects: 
                    <strong>Hostile</strong> tiles, these tiles will spawn a monster which players draw from a card deck which will give a random level monster (0-2) for the current version there are only a few monsters.
                    Mnsters will do damage each turn they are left on the board, players can als gain <strong>Items and Equipement</strong> after defeating them.
                    <br>Monster levels are random and not determined on a players level or stats.
                <br>
            <br>
        The other negative tile is a <strong>Effect</strong> tile, this will inflict a status ailement on a player when they land on this tile, these can be a variety of deadly conconctions. Burn, Poison, Slow or even Weakness affects.</p>

      <div id="monsters">
          <h1>Monster Cards</h1>
          <p>
              <h3>Monster Types</h3>
              Monster's have different types of effects or are generally weak to certain types of attacks, for example a <strong>Fire Element</strong> would be weak to any water attacks.
              <br>
              With this in mind, while we haven't added any characters who can deal different types of magic, we also haven't added the elemental type monsters for the initial build. 
              This will help keep the game balanced during beta testing and allow focus on the base structure.
              <br>
              However, we plan to add new <strong>Monsters</strong> along with new races and characters. The characters available from the first release are only starter models and will be further developed as the project improves.
          </p>
          <p>
              In the initial build the monsters available can deal special status ailments such as poison or bleed, depending on a dice roll factor and if any debuffs have been placed on the monster.
              <br>
              <h3>How they appear</h3>
              Monsters appear on the deck tile cards, on the bottom of the card there is a counter which determines the difficulty of the monster. For the intial release there is only one difficulty, however more will be implemnted throughout the year.
              <br>
              Once a Monster has been located on a card, players must try and defeat them as soon as possible whereas the conspirators task is to prolong the damage being done.
              If a monster isn't destroyed within a turn then the monster will deal damage to all players within a certain radius (yet to be established).
              <br>
              For the base structure of summoning monsters any that appear through tile cards have their levels randomised along with their damage outputs, future features will see a conspirator who can summon monsters after meeting certain requirements and depending on their stats will depend on the outcome of the monsters stats.
          </p>
          <p>
              <h3>Monster Cards</h3>
              The cards are designed showing players the HP and basic stats, however skills are hidden for players with low perception or without a passive skill.
              <br>
              Here is an example card for the monsters, please note these may change before the actual release.
              <!-- Place the assembled monster card here at a later date, add before release date/winter. This is not needed for the original project and is being used for the full live version released in July.-->
              <br>
              When attempting to damage a monster, players are required to roll the dice. This affects the damage output and if a player rolls a perfect dice or a double they inflict critical damage.
              If a player is using a status affect skill they must roll a double to successfully apply the affect, if a player fails the roll they have a chance to recieve a fraction of damage.
              <br>
              <h3>Monsters</h3>
              Below is a list of the monsters currently being added to the beta version.

    <h3>Traders</h3>
    Traders are a form of merchants who sell a variety of different wares to players. Upon encountering a trader it will generate random wares everytime the player enters the tile, this allows for purchasing better equipement and rarer items through chance (Luck also affects the wares being sold by rarity.)
    While <strong>Traders</strong> aren't seperate vendors and function under one official style, they are linked to the shops in locations meaning players can obtain items in towns and not just through encounters.
    <h3>Events</h3>
    <strong>Events</strong> are also randomly generated throughout the game, when a player interacts with an event they can offer a variety of different choices, all choices are roll base chances or skill check requirements.

    Upon entering the event a player is given prompts which can use: 
    <li>Skills</li>
    <li>Stats</li>
    <li>Luck</li>
    <li>Strength</li>
    For example:
    <br>
    "Hey there stranger, my wagon appears to have turned over, would you lend your aid?"
    Options:
    Fix the wagon- 6 Strength. +1 Item <br>
    Walk away- +2 Evil Reputation
